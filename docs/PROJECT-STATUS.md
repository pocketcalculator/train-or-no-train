- ✅ **This status summary** (current document)

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Training Data
```bash
cd train-detection-local

# Create directory structure and organize images
python src/dataset_helper.py
```

**What you need**:
- **Minimum**: 100 images per category (train_present, no_train)
- **Recommended**: 200+ images per category
- **Consistency**: Same camera angle/position as your deployment location

### Step 2: Set Up Local Environment
```bash
# Still in train-detection-local directory
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create Python virtual environment
- Install all required packages (TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.)
- Verify installation and dependencies

### Step 3: Train Your Model
```bash
# Quick automated training
./scripts/quick_train.sh

# OR interactive training with options
python src/train_model.py
```

**Expected results**:
- Training time: 15-30 minutes
- Target accuracy: >90%
- Output: `models/train_detection_model.h5`

### Step 4: Test Your Model
```bash
# Quick validation test
./scripts/quick_test.sh

# OR comprehensive testing
python src/test_model.py
```

### Step 5: Azure Integration (After Local Success)
```bash
cd ../azure-function

# Deploy cloud infrastructure
./deploy-to-azure.sh

# Upload your trained model to Azure Blob Storage
# Configure function to use your model
```

## 📊 Expected Workflow

```
1. Gather Images → 2. Setup Environment → 3. Train Model → 4. Test Model → 5. Deploy to Azure
   (Your task)      (./setup.sh)       (Quick train)   (Quick test)   (Azure deployment)
```

## 🎛 Technology Stack Summary

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before You Start Training
1. **Image Quality Matters**: Use clear, consistent images from your actual camera location
2. **Balanced Dataset**: Roughly equal numbers of train/no-train images
3. **Variety**: Include different lighting conditions, weather, train types
4. **Ground Truth**: Ensure your labels are accurate (train vs no-train)

### Training Tips
- Start with a small dataset (50 images each) to validate the pipeline
- Monitor training progress - accuracy should improve over epochs
- If accuracy is low (<85%), add more diverse training data
- Save and test different model checkpoints

### Performance Expectations
- **Accuracy**: Should reach >90% on validation data
- **Speed**: <1 second inference time per image
- **Model Size**: ~50-100MB for the trained model
- **Training Time**: 15-30 minutes on modern hardware

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Setup Issues
```bash
# If Python environment fails
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training Issues
- **Low accuracy**: Need more/better training data
- **Out of memory**: Reduce batch_size in training script
- **Slow training**: Consider GPU acceleration (optional)

### Testing Issues
- **Model not found**: Check that training completed successfully
- **Poor test results**: Verify test images match training data style

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Training Success
- ✅ Model accuracy >90% on validation set
- ✅ Training completes without errors
- ✅ Confusion matrix shows good separation
- ✅ Model file `train_detection_model.h5` is created

### Testing Success  
- ✅ Quick test script runs without errors
- ✅ Model correctly identifies train/no-train test images
- ✅ Confidence scores are reasonable (>0.8 for correct predictions)
